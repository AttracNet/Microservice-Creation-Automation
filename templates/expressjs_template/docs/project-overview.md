# Project Overview

The Project Overview document provides a high-level understanding of the project's structure, components, and architecture. It's a great starting point for new contributors or team members to familiarize themselves with the project's organization and functionality.

## Views

The `views` directory contains the templates or views used to render the HTML pages in your web application. These files are responsible for presenting data to the user and often include HTML, along with dynamic content rendered using a templating engine.

Each view file corresponds to a specific page or a partial view in your application. The separation of views from the rest of the application logic promotes a clean and modular code structure.

### Recommended Practices

- Keep views organized based on their related routes or functionality.
- Leverage a templating engine, such as EJS or Handlebars, to enhance dynamic content generation.
- Consider reusability by breaking down complex views into smaller partials.

For more details on creating and managing views, please refer to [Views Documentation](./views/readme.md).
